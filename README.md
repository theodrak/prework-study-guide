# Prework Bootcamp Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for the coding boot camp students. It works as a store of information allowing the students to write and access the notes on 4 areas of webdevelopment. These include HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript. The project was built to facilitate/showcase the basics of web development. The project taught me to combine all the elements into a fuctioning webpage.
